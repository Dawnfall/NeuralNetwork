# Neural Network
## About
##### This is mostly an educational project that showcases the base idea of neural network and its underlying math. Along with it come tests and an example digic classification project that intends to showcase its use. Project is still under development.

## Dependecies
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) : used for matrix/vector operations which are not the intention of this project
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) : Engine for digit classification project
- [SDL_image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image) : SDL extention for image loading
- [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) : For digit classification UI
- [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) : Project build system

## How to use
Project is self contained, needed libraries are included. To create Visual studio solution just run GenerateSolution.bat

## State

Neural network itself seems to work. It passes the test as well as perform XOR classification. The example project itself is not working yet and is the main focus of further development.
